Great question! Here are my top suggestions for enhancing the app, organized by impact:

## 🔥 High Impact, Medium Effort

**1. Undo/Redo (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y)**
- Most requested feature in diagramming tools
- Saves time when experimenting with layouts
- ~3-4 hours to implement

**2. Copy/Paste Nodes (Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V)**
- Huge time-saver for repetitive architectures
- Common pattern: copy a microservice template, paste 5 times
- ~2-3 hours

**3. SVG Export**
- Vector format = scales perfectly for presentations
- Better quality than PNG for documentation
- ~1 hour (similar to existing PNG export)

**4. Cost Estimation Badge**
- Show "~$500/mo" on nodes
- Help stakeholders understand TCO immediately
- Could use hard-coded estimates per service type
- ~4-6 hours (with basic estimates)

## 💡 High Value, Lower Effort

**5. Export as Architecture Document (PDF)**
- Combine: Title + Diagram + Workflow in one PDF
- Perfect for sharing with stakeholders
- ~2-3 hours using jsPDF

**6. Template Library**
- Pre-built starter diagrams: "3-Tier Web App", "Event-Driven Microservices", etc.
- Users click, customize, done
- ~3-4 hours for 5-10 templates

**7. Search Services in Left Panel**
- Already have search box, but make it more prominent
- Filter by name or category
- ~1 hour enhancement

**8. Auto-Layout Button**
- One-click to reorganize messy diagrams
- Use force-directed graph algorithm
- ~4-6 hours

## 🎨 Polish Features

**9. Dark Mode**
- Professional presentations often use dark backgrounds
- Popular feature
- ~3-4 hours

**10. Connection Label Templates**
- Quick-select: "HTTPS", "SQL", "AMQP", "Event Grid", "REST API"
- Faster than typing
- ~1-2 hours

**11. Keyboard Shortcuts Panel**
- Press `?` to see all shortcuts
- Better discoverability
- ~1 hour

## 🚀 Advanced Features

**12. Collaboration Mode**
- Real-time editing with multiple users
- Like Figma for Azure diagrams
- Significant effort (weeks)

**13. Best Practice Validator**
- "⚠️ Consider adding Application Insights"
- "⚠️ No Key Vault detected - store secrets securely"
- AI-powered suggestions
- ~8-10 hours

**14. Export to Bicep/ARM Template**
- Reverse of ARM import
- Generate deployable IaC from diagram
- Very complex (weeks)

## 🎯 My Top 3 Recommendations

If I had to pick what would make the biggest impact:

1. **Undo/Redo** - Most impactful UX improvement
2. **Cost Estimation** - Unique value proposition, helps with business decisions
3. **Template Library** - Faster time-to-value for new users
